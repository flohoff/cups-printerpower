This is my solution to automatically turn on/off a laser printer connected
to a USB controllable power socket.

I use the cups "job-created" notification to issue a poweron. 15 Minutes
after the last job has been queued and the queue is empty the printer will
be turned off again.

Installation
============

Move the `cups-notifier` to your cups notifier directory e.g. `/usr/lib/cups/notifier`
on a standard Debian installation.

Move the `printeron` and `printerpoweoff` scripts to `/usr/local/sbin`.

Create a cron job to call `printerpoweroff` e.g. in `/etc/cron.d/printer`

    */5 *	* * *	root	/usr/local/sbin/printerpoweroff | logger -t printer

Then create a `subscriptions.conf` in the cups config directory - typically `/etc/cups/`

    <Subscription 1>
    Events all
    Recipient poweron
    PrinterName paperjam
    LeaseDuration 0
    Interval 0
    ExpirationTime 0
    </Subscription>

This will send notifications on printer `paperkam`to the `poweron` notifier script.
